# H4Werk

As of May 2015, H4 visa holders are finally eligible to apply for EAD. This helps unlock many qualified spouses (many of which woman) of H1B visa holders to legally work. That's awesome except the process is vigorous, complicated, many application rejections are due to missing documents, incorrect payment, avoidable human errors. Applying for work permit shouldn't be this painful. We can help.
